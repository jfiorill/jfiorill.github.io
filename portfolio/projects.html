      <h3>Crystal Clashers</h3>
      <p>
        This is a two-player game with twelve different characters to choose from, created in Scratch. In a dodgeball-style game, players launch crystals at each other until one player's health is completely gone. Each character has a unique ability, receives buffs as their health lowers, and has a special move that charges over time.
